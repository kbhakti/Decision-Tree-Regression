# Decision-Tree-Regression

In this article, we will build a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs using Python in Jupyter Notebook, leveraging various libraries. A basic understanding of Python and statistics is recommended. The model will analyze key factors such as gender, region, number of children, and other relevant features to predict insurance costs for new patients. This model has also been published on Kaggle.
